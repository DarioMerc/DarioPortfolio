          Im an aspiring junior developer. To me programming is like being a
          virtual architect in an landscape that is constantly changing.
          Everyday the rules and technologies are constantly shifting.
          Regardless of this everchanging landscape, the feeling of seeing the
          end result is unparalled.

    </section>

};

export default Intro;
